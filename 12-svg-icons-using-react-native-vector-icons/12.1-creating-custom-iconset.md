# Creating custom icon set

`react-native-vector-icons` supports using custom icon sets if you do not want to use the icons which come bundled with it or if you want to add your own icons. It supports Fontello and IcoMoon to create custom fonts. We used IcoMoon to convert our SVGs to a config which is readable by the library.


### Setting up the framework
Install the npm module using npm or Yarn.
```js
npm install --save react-native-vector-icons
```
or
```js
yarn add react-native-vector-icons
```


### Configuring your project to support custom icon sets.

We will use IcoMoon to support custom icons/fonts. Icomoon is a free and open source application which lets you convert a set of SVG icons to fonts. It is a front end only app and does not upload your icons anywhere, so there will be no privacy concerns!

The steps for the configuration are as follows:

* Create a resources folder where we will keep our custom font file (.ttf).

* Do `react-native link react-native-vector-icons`. This will set up the vector icons framework for you.

That's it, you are done with the setup. Now we need to get the TTF file and place it in the `resources/fonts` folder that we just created.

### How to generate .ttf fonts using IcoMoon:

1. Open the [IcoMoon application.](https://icomoon.io/app)

2. Remove the current set (if there is one) and create a new empty set and give your preferred name (remember to give the same name everywhere).
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/1.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
  </div>
  <br>

3. Drag and drop your SVG files onto the tool.
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/2.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
  </div>
  <br>

4. Select the files which you want to export. Select all if you want to export all the icons.
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/3.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
  </div>
  <br>

  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/4.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
  </div>
  <br>

5. After the selection, click Generate Font. This will download a zip file to your system.
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/5.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
  </div>
  <br>

6. The zip file will contain a selection.json file and a fonts folder containing a .ttf file. We only need these two files to use fonts in react-native.
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/6.png" style="width: 40%;display:inline-block;vertical-align: middle;margin:0" hspace="40">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/7.png" style="width: 40%;display:inline-block;vertical-align: middle;margin:0" hspace="40">
  </div>
  <br>

7. Put the font file (.ttf) in the `resources/fonts` folder and add the following script to the package.json:

  ```
  "rnpm": {

  		"assets": [
  			"resources/fonts"
  		]
  	}
  ```
  This script will copy the font files to both Android and iOS folders. After this, whenever we want to update the fonts, we will do `react-native link react-native-vector-icons` and the fonts will be copied/updated automatically to both Android and iOS projects.

8. Put the JSON file (selection.json) in your app and create a file called CustomIcon.js. Import the selection.json in CustomIcon.js.

  ```js
  import {createIconSetFromIcoMoon} from 'react-native-vector-icons';
  import icoMoonConfig from './selection.json';
  export default createIconSetFromIcoMoon(icoMoonConfig);
  ```

9. That's it! To use a font simply import the file as a React component and pass the icon name and size (optional) or even style.

  ```js
  import CustomIcon from './components/CustomIcon.js'

  <CustomIcon name='android' /> //To use the icon
  <CustomIcon name='android' size={25} /> // To pass size
  <CustomIcon name='android' style={styles.androidIcon} /> // To pass custom tyle
  ```

### Changing file names of the font file
The default name of the font file is `icomoon.ttf`. If you want to give it a different name, go to Preferences after step 5 and change the name there before downloading. Also, make sure that if you change the font file name, give the same name to the set as well (by default it is "Untitled Set").

It is not recommended to change the filename of `.ttf` font file after the setup/native linking. The filename gets written in `project.pbxproj` and `Info.plist` and the file gets copied to ` android/app/src/main/assets/fonts/` once you run the link command. If you wish to change the filename, you would need to take care of changing the above 2 files as well, and removing the unused icon from the android folder which might cause problems if not done properly.

### How do I add/delete icons from the font file (.ttf)

You can easily change/delete the contents of the font file. The tool only needs the `selection.json` file, which defines the font configuration. The steps for the same are as follows:

1. Open [IcoMoon App](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select)

* Upload the current selection.json file.
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/8.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
  </div>
  <br>

* Edit/delete the icon using the tools on top. (Adding an icon is the same as step 3 mentioned above)
  <br>
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/9.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
  </div>
  <br>

* After the editing is complete, generate a new font file by following the steps 5 and 6 mentioned above. Once you have the new font file and the new selection.json file, place them in their appropriate locations in the app and do `react-native link react-native-vector-icons`.

That's how you change the icons. Pretty neat huh?


###### This will let us convert any SVG image to a font which is scalable, platform independent and easy to style. What else can you ask for, right?
  <div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="/assets/images/12/giphy.gif" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
  </div>
  <br>
