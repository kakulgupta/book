# Integration with react-navigation

Our framework setup is completed, so is the toggle language feature. Everything seems to be working, except for one thing. The header text is not getting re-rendered on language change. Have a look at the screenshot below.

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/13/13.3.png" style="width: 40%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
</div>
<br/>
The current language is `Hindi`. Everything changes in the UI except the header.

_But why is this happening?_

_We are using translate function in the routes file. Right?_

Answer: Yes we are, but how will the `router` know that it has to re-render?

Luckily, react-navigation provides us with a feature to pass `screenProps`. ScreenProps will be passed to each navigator instance's navigationConfig. We can pass screenProps as a prop to the `Router` component in our `App.container`.

>App.container.js

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/13/13.3-app-diff.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
</div>
<br/>


However, change in screenProps will __not__ cause re-rendering of Router. Have a look at the [issue here](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/577) to know why.

To fix this, we would use a function instead of an object for our navigationConfig (have a look at Header Configuration topic [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/headers.html#using-params-in-the-title)).
ScreenProps are passed to this function and we can use them to get the currentLanguage and then translation.

Instead of
```js
navigationOptions: {
  title: translate('HOME_startTakingNotes')
}
```

we will do
```js
navigationOptions: ({screenProps}) => {
  const title = I18n.translate('HOME_startTakingNotes', screenProps.language);
  return {title};
};
```

Doing this will cause the header text to change dynamically based on the currentLanguage. Let's create a utility for this so that we don't have to rewrite this function.

>language.utils.js

```js
export const translateHeaderText = (langKey) => ({screenProps}) => {
  const title = I18n.translate(langKey, screenProps.language);
  return {title};
};
```

Now let's use this utility in all our routes file.
Example usage:

>routes/index.js

```js
navigationOptions: translateHeaderText('HOME_startTakingNotes')
```

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/13/13.3-done.png" style="width: 40%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
</div>
<br/>

Our app now supports internationalization without any bugs. 🕵🏻
