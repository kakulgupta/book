# iOS custom native module

Let's build the same native module for iOS that we built for Android in the last chapter. The purpose remains the same, **the native module should get you the device name set on an iPhone.**

Before we continue, just a reminder that if you want to write code for iOS, please **open the iOS project on Xcode**.
This is because Xcode is built for iOS development and it will help you resolve the trivial errors that otherwise would take up too much time.

### Let's get started

1. Open the `./ios/` project folder. Open the .xcodeproj file or the .xcworkspace file in Xcode.

2. Create a header file `Device.h` by following the steps
 `File -> New -> File -> Header File` and then name the file `Device.h` and choose the targets. Create a new folder Device if you like to organize files in a folder like me.

   <img src="/assets/images/16/16.2/16.2-ios-setup.png" style="width: 80%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
 </div>
 <br>

3. Let modify our `Device.h` file.
  >ios/Device/Device.h

  ```c
  #import <React/RCTBridgeModule.h>

  @interface Device : NSObject <RCTBridgeModule>
  @end
  ```
  This is our main custom native modules header file.

4. Now let's create the corresponding implementation file `Device.m` in the same location.
  >ios/Device/Device.m

  ```c
  #import "Device.h"

  @implementation Device

  RCT_EXPORT_MODULE();

  @end
  ```

5. Similar to Android's getName method, here we have RCT_EXPORT_MODULE() macro. If no name is explicitly provided, it will take the name of the module. Here the name of the module is 'Device'. **In order to expose a method from native module to Javascript just write a method inside the RCT_EXPORT_METHOD macro**. These methods can be accessed from `NativeModules` of the `react-native` package.

  See the example below:

  >ios/Device/Device.m

  ```c
  #import "Device.h"
  #import <UIKit/UIKit.h>

  @implementation Device

  //export the name of the native module as 'Device' since no explicit name is mentioned
  RCT_EXPORT_MODULE();

  //exports a method getDeviceName to javascript
  RCT_EXPORT_METHOD(getDeviceName:(RCTResponseSenderBlock)callback){
    @try{
      NSString *deviceName = [[UIDevice currentDevice] name];
      callback(@[[NSNull null], deviceName]);
    }
    @catch(NSException *exception){
      callback(@[exception.reason, [NSNull null]]);
    }
  }

  @end
  ```

  Here we are exporting a method `getDeviceName()` from native to Javascript.
  This method can be accessed in JS via
  ```js
  import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
  NativeModules.Device.getDeviceName((err ,name) => {
      console.log(err, name);
  });
  ```

  NativeModules has a key named 'Device'. This is basically the same name exported by RCT_EXPORT_METHOD.

  We passed a callback to get the value from the NativeModule.

### That's it, let's give it a shot!

In a Javascript file, you can access the module methods using `NativeModules.<moduleName>.<methodName>`
>app/index.js

Just add

```js
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
...
...
  NativeModules.Device.getDeviceName((err, name) => console.log(err, name));
...
...
```

Running this on an iOS simulator returns.
<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="/assets/images/16/16.2/16.2-ios-finished.png" style="width: 90%;display:inline-block;" hspace="20">
</div>
<br>


Woot! That was simple!
